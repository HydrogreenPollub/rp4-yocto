# Hardware
The hardware chosen for the project is a **raspberry pi 4** with two shields. The shields provide us with additional features.

This package of the **pi** and the shields is internally referred to as **"the sandwich"**.

 One of the shields is the `SB-Components LoRa Hat` responsible for transmitting data over `LoRA`. The other shield is the `Waveshare RS485 HAT` which provides us with two `RS485` ports, a `CAN` interface, as well as a convenient way to power the board with an additional port.

The system also includes two `Waveshare LCD HDMI` displays.

The other peripherals are plugged into the **pi** via **USB**. Those peripherals are:
* 2 x Camera
* GPS
