\section{Market analysis}

There are existing solutions for race telemetry.

% TODO give literature for reasoning

\subsection{MoTeC}
\verb|MoTeC| is a child company of \verb|Bosch| and it it specializes in high-end motorsport electonics.\\

Their solutions are widely considered to be the industry standard used by professional racing teams.\\

They offer \verb|Engine Control Units (ECUs)| with built-in telemetry features,
such as their \verb|M150| unit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:motec-m150}.

\end{figure}

They also produce dedicated data loggers, such as the \verb|L120| logger.

\subsection{AIM Technologies}
More popular with amateur teams

\subsection{RaceCapture (by Autosport Labs)}

This option is an open source project.

\subsection{Analysis Conclusions}

None of the existing solutions fit specific the needs of a hydrogen vehicle.

One of the multiple issues with using an existing system designed for a
commercially available vehicle is that such vehicles are standardized to use
certain industry grade solutions (such as OBD2). These are not used on the
target vehicle.
