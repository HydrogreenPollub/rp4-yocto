\section{Market analysis}

The requirements for the target vehicle are uncommon on the market.
It uses various solutions that aren't commonly associated with the automotive market (like \verb|RS485|).
It's also powered by a hydrogen fuel cell which is still not widely seen on production cars.

There are existing solutions for race telemetry, but most of them are designed with production cars in mind.

\subsection{Existing Options}

\paragraph{MoTeC}
A child company of \verb|Bosch| and it it specializes in high-end motorsport electronics.\\

% TODO cite manufacturer
Their solutions are widely considered to be the industry standard used by professional racing teams.\\

They offer \verb|Engine Control Units (ECUs)| with built-in telemetry features,
such as their \verb|M150| unit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:motec-m150}.

% TODO get picture of Solo 2 DL
Their \verb|Solo 2 DL data logger| is one of their flagship data loggers.
It is built with track racing in mind. It has built in data about various tracks.
It collects accelerometer readings as well as \verb|CAN| data.

\paragraph{RaceCapture (by Autosport Labs)}
An open source project.

Features a robust app for analyzing the data collected, as well as configuring the system.
It can even be run on a \verb|RaspberryPI| for a true dashboard experience.

\subsection{Analysis Conclusions}

None of the existing solutions fit specific the needs of a hydrogen vehicle.\\

One of the multiple issues with using an existing system designed for a
commercially available vehicle is that such vehicles are standardized to use
certain industry grade solutions (such as OBD2). These are not used on the
target vehicle.
