There are existing solutions for race telemetry.

Some examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[]
          {\large\textbf{MoTeC}}\\
          Industry standard used by racing teams

    \item[]
          {\large\textbf{AIM Technologies}}\\
          More popular with amateur teams

    \item[]
          {\large\textbf{RaceCapture (by Autosport Labs)}}\\
          This option is actually an opensource project.
\end{itemize}

However all of these systems are very expensive and none of them fit the needs
of a hydrogen vehicle.

One of the multiple issues with using an existing system designed for a
commercially available vehicle is that such vehicles are standardized to use
certain solutions that we're not using (such as OBD2)
