{\Large \textbf{Abstract}}

This thesis focuses on the design and implementation of a \verb|Linux| based telemetry
system designed for a custom hydrogen vehicle participating in the \verb|Shell Eco-Marathon| competition.
This system provided a competitive edge over other teams. During the design process the unique vehicle
architecture forced the use of a fully custom system.

The objective was to create a full hardware-software solution capable of collecting, processing and sending
information to a base station. It uses a \verb|Raspberry Pi| and is able to integrate with peripherals
using \verb|CAN| and \verb|RS485|.

The base system was built using \verb|Yocto| and the telemetry application was written in \verb|C++|.

During the competition the system proved highly useful in troubleshooting various issues. It also provided
the team with data that will help to direct the efforts in future development.
