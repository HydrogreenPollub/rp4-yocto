Abstract

This thesis focuses on the design and implementation of a \verb|Linux| based telemetry
system designed for a custom hydrogen vehicle participating in the \verb|Shell Eco-Marathon| competition.
Such a system provides a competitive edge over other teams and the unique vehicle architecture forces
the use of a fully custom system.

The objective is to create a full hardware-software solution capable of collecting, processing and sending
information to a base station. It should use a \verb|Raspberry Pi| and be able to integrate with peripherals
using \verb|CAN| and \verb|RS485|.
