\paragraph{sb-components LoRa HAT}
This module provides a simple way to transmit data over LoRa. This is how information is sent to the base station.

\paragraph{Waveshare RS485 CAN HAT (B)}
This module provides both CAN and RS485 interfaces, which are necessary for communicating with the electrical components of the vehicle.

\paragraph{GPS GU-502GGB}
This module receives \verb|NMEA| packets via \verb|GPS|. Such packets contain geographic coordinates, speed and even the current time.
This data is crucial for analyzing a race. It lets the racing team optimize fuel usage throughout the track.
