\subsubsection{Peripherals}
Each peripheral has its own way of communicating with our system.
Each one also runs in a separate thread for performance reasons.

We initialize them in the \verb|main.cpp| file.

Notice how the creation of the \verb|CAN| thread has a different syntax.
This is because the \verb|Can| class is a functor. This was done to showcase
the different syntax possible in \verb|C++|.

To achieve this behavior the \verb|CAN| class is defined in the following way:

The other peripherals are represented by plain functions, since it's a simpler solution.
