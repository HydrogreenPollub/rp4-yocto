\subsubsection{Peripherals}
Each peripheral has its own way of communicating with our system.
Each one also runs in a separate thread for performance reasons.

We initialize them in the \verb|main.cpp| file.

\end{figure}

All of these peripherals are represented by plain functions. In \verb|C++| threads can be created
by passing these functions to a \verb|std::thread()| function. After that the program can run that thread
by calling it's \verb|.join()| method \cite{cpp-programming-language}.
