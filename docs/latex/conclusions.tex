\section{Conclusions}

During the \verb|Shell Eco-Marathon 2025| the potential of having a telemetry system was
realized. It helped greatly with diagnosing vehicle issues by allowing for a real time view
of all the parameters.

In the future with more teams using \verb|LoRa| for transferring telemetry information,
it will be very likely that additional parameter tuning will be required.

As another potential area of improvement \verb|LoRa WAN| would likely make it possible to
have multiple vehicles sending telemetry information to a single base station.
While such a case won't happen during a race, it would simplify testing of vehicles.
