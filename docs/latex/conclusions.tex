\section{Conclusions}

During the \verb|Shell Eco-Marathon 2025| the potential of having a telemetry system was
realized. It helped greatly with diagnosing vehicle issues by allowing for a real time view
of all the parameters.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}
While the telemetry system proved useful, several areas remain open for improvement
and it is important to set new goals for the competition next year.

In the future with more teams using \verb|LoRa| for transferring telemetry information,
transmission parameter tuning will likely be required. As another potential area of improvement \verb|LoRa WAN| would likely make it possible to
have multiple vehicles sending telemetry information to a single base station.
While such a case won't happen during a race, it would simplify testing of vehicles.

The kernel logs being sent over \verb|LoRa| will also need to be addressed in a more robust way than just turning off the logs.

Currently the development procedure is very time consuming due to needing to write an entire system image to an \verb|SD card|
every time that the firmware changes. It would greatly speed up the process if a partial update mechanism was implemented.
One potential way of performing such updates could be \verb|systemd-sysupdate|.
