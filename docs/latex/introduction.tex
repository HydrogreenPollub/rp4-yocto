\section{Introduction}

This project is part of a hydrogen vehicle that participates in the shell eco
marathon competition. With the nature of the competition it is crucial to focus
on optimizing the vehicle as much as possible.

Changing the different parameters of the vehicle blindly would potentially
yield some results. It would however be very time consuming without any
additional information. In order to analyze the the performance of the vehicle,
a telemetry system was needed.

The information that we gather will help us track the performance of the
hydrogen fuel cell, as well as the different voltages in real time. This fact
is crucial not only for research and development purposes, but it is also
incredibly helpful during the race. It lets us judge the situation with great
accuracy and decide when it is possible to push the vehicle to its limits and
when caution should be taken.
