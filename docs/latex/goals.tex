\section{Scope and Goals}

The final telemetry system should be able to integrate with the existing vehicle architecture.
It needs to be modular, so that the two target vehicles with slightly different architectures can both benefit from it.
It also needs to be extendable in case new features need to be added in the future.\\

To simplify the development process it needs to provide a way to access the logs on the target system.
