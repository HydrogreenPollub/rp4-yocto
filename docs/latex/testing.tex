\section{Testing}

The project was tested both in preparation to as well as during the \verb|Shell Eco-Marathon 2025|.\\

During the testing of \verb|LoRa| communication it was discovered that the module offers an impressive range of
over a kilometer in an urban environment with very little data loss. It was also shown that for short ranges of up to
a kilometer on an open field the antenna choice had little impact on communication.\\

One issue that was discovered in preparation to the race was intermittent failure to receive \verb|CAN| packets on the steering wheel controller.
It would periodically show impossible values to the driver. This was however unrelated to the telemetry system and was fixed by the steering wheel developer.
